            <h2> About me</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Enea Ntilka, and I’m a 29-year-old junior software tester.

                Until recently, I worked in hospitality as a barista. My career shift began while working at an IT company, where my daily interactions with developers sparked a newfound interest in the tech world. Fascinated by the industry’s complexity and potential, I was inspired to explore it further.
                
                My girlfriend has been a tremendous support throughout this journey, encouraging me to take my first steps into IT. Her belief in me helped me navigate the early stages of this career change, which wasn’t always easy. With her encouragement, I discovered my interest in testing—something that aligns well with my background in electronic engineering and my love for understanding how things work.
                
                To lay a solid foundation, I pursued the ISTQB Foundation Level certification, which I’m proud of achieving in very few weeks. Since then, I’ve engaged in hands-on practice, testing various websites, documenting findings, and refining my skills. This website, which I built with the help of AI, is part of my journey as I look forward to contributing to the industry as a software tester.
                
                Thank you for visiting my page, and I’m excited to connect and continue learning on my path to becoming an accomplished software tester.

                <h2>The Importance of QA in Software Development</h2>
                <h3>Quality Assurance (QA) plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of products and services across various industries. Here are ten reasons why QA is important</h3>
                <p><strong>1)</strong>Ensures Product Quality: QA processes help identify defects and ensure that products meet specified requirements, leading to higher quality and customer satisfaction.</p>
                <p><strong>2)</strong>Reduces Costs: By catching issues early in the development process, QA helps minimize the costs associated with fixing defects later, which can be significantly higher.</p>
                <p><strong>3)</strong>Enhances Customer Satisfaction: Delivering a high-quality product fosters trust and loyalty among customers, leading to positive reviews and repeat business.</p>
                <p><strong>4)</strong>Increases Efficiency: QA helps streamline processes and improve workflows, leading to increased efficiency in development and production.</p>
                <p><strong>5)</strong>Mitigates Risks: Through thorough testing and validation, QA helps identify potential risks and issues before they escalate, reducing the likelihood of project failure.</p>
                <p><strong>6)</strong>Supports Compliance: Many industries have regulatory requirements that mandate specific quality standards. QA ensures compliance with these regulations, avoiding legal issues and penalties.</p>
                <p><strong>7)</strong>Facilitates Continuous Improvement: QA processes promote a culture of continuous improvement by encouraging regular assessments and adjustments to enhance product and process quality.</p>
                <p><strong>8)</strong>Boosts Team Morale: A strong QA culture can enhance team confidence and morale, as team members feel supported and assured that their work meets high standards.</p>
                <p><strong>9)</strong>Improves Market Reputation: Consistently delivering quality products helps build a strong market reputation, attracting new customers and retaining existing ones.</p>
                <p><strong>10)</strong>Provides Valuable Feedback: QA processes provide critical insights and feedback that can inform future development, ensuring that teams learn from past experiences and continually improve.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>I have completed functional testing and UI/UX testing on three different websites. Here are the analytical insights on what I accomplished:</p>
            <h3>Functional Testing</h3>
            <h3>●  <a href="https://www.vacuumlabs.com" target="_blank">Vacuumlabs</a> Website</h3>

            <p>During my testing of the Vacuumlabs website, I reported critical 
                defects in the "Apply Now" form, enhancing the user experience 
                for sales applicants. I developed test scenarios for the job 
                application section, identified UI issues, and suggested 
                improvements. Additionally, I used JIRA for bug reporting and 
                JMeter for performance testing to support the development team.</p>
            <h3>UI/UX Testing</h3>
            <h3>● <a href="https://moneyhoon.sk/" target="_blank">Moneyhoon</a>Website</h3> 
            <p>I detected UI/UX issues and suggested enhancements to improve 
                the overall user interface. I prepared and submitted a detailed 
                defect report, contributing to the website's quality through 
                thorough testing and feedback.</p>
            <h3>● <a href="https://bainry.com/" target="_blank">Bainry</a> Website</h3> 
            <p>conducted thorough UI testing to identify defects, discovering 
                a significant issue with text display when switching from Slovak 
                to English. I prepared and submitted a detailed defect report 
                outlining my findings and suggestions for improvement. </p>
